# IMELE-based training routines

This folder contains routines to train the model, given a series of pairs of satellite images and height reference data.

The approach and large parts of the code are based on https://github.com/speed8928/IMELE.

Run the training routines with the following command

    python ./train.py

after having written in `test0.csv` a series of pairs. 

This is still a work in progress, most likely the code will not work in reasonable time, or will not work at all.
